# Network-Data-Visualizations
There are two projects in this directory, explained as follows:

Monthly Metrics Report:

This report is designed as a public presentation to showcase the overall performance of the University of Utah Network Operations Center. Details about devices as well as completed work are contained within.  I have been updating this report monthly since June 2020.

Network Fast Facts:

This is a report published yearly in the Node 4 University Information Technology newsletter.  I built each report from scratch using adobe illustrator and information I gathered about the network.  The purpose of this report is to create a quick summary of some interesting facts about the network that is easy to read and pleasant to look at.
